# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Tesla-Customer-Reviews

Objective: Scraped Tesla customer reviews for 2024 from Trustpilot.com and perform sentiment analysis to uncover 
key themes and customer opinions.

Data Preparation: Preprocessed the text data by removing stopwords, punctuation, and lemmatizing the reviews to 
create a clean and structured dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Performed topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify dominant 
topics in customer reviews. Identified customer service as a key theme using topic modeling.

Sentiment Analysis:
- Transformer Models: Leveraged pre-trained transformer models (BERT and RoBERTa) to compute sentiment 
scores for each review.
- Focused Sentiment Analysis: Analyzed sentiments specifically on customer service topics to gain actionable 
insights.
- Visualization: Created bar plots to illustrate the sentiment scores across different topics to identify strengths 
and areas for improvement in customer experience
